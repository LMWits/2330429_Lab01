In this assignment I got orientated into GitHub.

I started off by making two meaningful commits, after editing the README.md. 
After that I crteated a branch called "feature/student-details". 
I then continued by making files for my site.
Firstly I made a text file called "student-info.txt".
Secondly I made this file, "report.md", with details on what I have done.
Lastly i will make "index.hmtl" which is an html file to flex my coding.
I continued to make meaningful commits (just in case my inital ones are not that meaningful).
I then renamed my special commit.

Thank you for reading my ramblings :)
