            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> 
                I am a simple girl. My name is Lukhanyiso Mhlongo. 
                It took me a while to come to this degree, but I became a coder before I decided to be a horrible mechanical engineer.
                Maybe I will become a subpar coder, but it's better to have a mid dream deferred rather than live in a nightmare with Taylor and McClaurin series.

            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>
                The latest project I made was inspired by my relatioship. I made a movie picking app called, PickMe. 
                To deter any unnecessary arguemnt about who has the better movie taste, I opted to let the randInt to hold our fate.
